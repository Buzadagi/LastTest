1,Opening,Narraition,"The atmosphere in the police station was thick with tension as Detective Marcus Greene stood by the window, staring out at the city below. The place was crowded with detectives, all eager to claim the spotlight. They had heard the rumors, seen the headlines, and now they were all here—ready to solve the case of the mysterious murder at the Porterfield estate. Everyone wanted their piece of fame, but Greene knew only one detective could claim the truth first.",briefing
2,Opening,Narraition,"\"Look at this mess, Greene,\" Chief Inspector Taylor muttered as he entered the room. \"The whole city's buzzing with detectives. But none of them seem to understand the magnitude of what we're dealing with here.\"",briefing
3,Opening,Narraition,"Greene turned, giving the chief a sharp look. \"You don't have to tell me. But someone needs to end this madness quickly.\"",briefing
4,Opening,Narraition,"Taylor shook his head. \"It's a disaster, Greene. The victim, Roderick Porterfield, was killed during his own dinner party. A party that featured an impromptu piano performance by Viktor Su?vitch. The rain started pouring before the evening’s events, and the air was heavy with tension. But by the end of the night, the weather cleared up and the house became a zoo. People were walking in and out, tipsy and careless. At the end of the concert, no one even noticed that Porterfield had disappeared. By the time they realized it, the house was nearly empty, save for a handful of guests. \"",briefing
5,Opening,Narraition,"The discovery of the body came after a search of the estate, and it wasn’t pretty. Found in an old barn, half-hidden in the shadows. Too late for us to do anything but confirm his death. Greene let out a slow breath, taking in the details. \"Did anyone see anything unusual, Chief? Any clues left behind?\"",briefing
6,Opening,Narraition,"Taylor grunted, pacing. \"It’s a mess, Marcus. Some say the pianist, Su?vitch, was drunk, but no one can confirm it. His performance didn’t impress anyone, apparently. The guests say he was off, not himself. But what does that have to do with murder? There was also a revolver found with the victim, along with a ticket for a ship leaving for Amsterdam. And neither had been used. The whole thing stinks. But the biggest problem is that we have no witnesses who saw anything suspicious. Everyone’s just pointing fingers at each other.\"",briefing
7,Opening,Narraition,"Greene nodded thoughtfully. \"So, it's up to us, then. If we don’t solve this before the others, they'll take credit, and we’ll be left with nothing.\"",briefing
8,Opening,Narraition,"Taylor nodded. \"Exactly. And don’t forget?everyone's a suspect. From the wife to the brother, to the guests. No one’s above suspicion, not even Su?vitch.\"",briefing
9,Opening,Narraition,"Greene’s eyes sharpened with resolve. He knew the stakes were higher than just solving a case. This was about reputation, and the clock was ticking.",briefing
10,Opening,Narraition,"\"Let’s get to work, Chief,\" he said, moving toward the door.",briefing
11,Opening,Narraition,"Taylor followed him. \"Be careful, Greene. This case might be more complicated than we think.\"",briefing
12,Opening,Narraition,"As they left the station, Greene couldn’t help but feel the weight of the competition pressing down on him. The other detectives were just as eager to claim the solution, and he knew the race was on. It was time to outsmart them all.",briefing
